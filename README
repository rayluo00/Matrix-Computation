You should notice two sub-directories: C and Java.  Each contains a serial
implementation of matrix multiplication.  As we saw in class, matrix
multiplcation is very easy to parallelize.  Your assignment is to parallelize
one of these implementations.

Right now, the programs compute a product and verify the answer.  Assuming that
the answer is correct, it prints the time taken to reach the answer.  You need
to modify the program so that it takes a command line option that specifies the
number of threads to use.  The following, for example, will use eight threads to
compute the answer:

  $java Matrix 8

or

  $./matrix 8

You should see a reasonable speed up as you increase the number of threads.
This, of course, does not continue indefinitely and you are limited by the
number of physical processors on your machine.

Pts  Why
---  -----
 3   Parallel matrix multiplication with a fixed number of threads.
 2   Variable number of threads
 2   Threads are properly joined
 3   Style (e.g., comments, variable names, etc.)


Note: If you convert both the C and the Java programs, I will "return" one point
to the score.  Think of it as one point of "extra credit", but you cannot get 11
points on this question.
